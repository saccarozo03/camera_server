# Camera Server - dependencies
#
# This project uses FastAPI as the web framework, Uvicorn as the ASGI server,
# and OpenCV for camera/video handling. The versions below are pinned for
# reproducible installs. If you prefer to track latest compatible releases,
# remove the '==' pins or replace with '>='. Optional packages like
# `python-dotenv` and `aiofiles` are included for convenience.
